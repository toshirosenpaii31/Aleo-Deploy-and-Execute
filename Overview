Deployment and execution of programs is done via four new developer CLI commands in snarkOS - decrypt, deploy, execute, scan, and transfer.

These CLI commands currently live in snarkOS, but can also be migrated to the Aleo SDK.

Note: All the operations are done client-side and do not require sending private keys or view keys to third parties.
